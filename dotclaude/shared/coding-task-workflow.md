# Coding Task Workflow Process

> This workflow process **MUST** be followed for all coding tasks. It ensures consistent, high-quality development practices using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and multi-agent collaboration.

## Overview

This workflow is designed to be followed sequentially, where each upper-level task must wait for the worker to finish before continuing with the next step. The process leverages multiple specialized agents via the Task tool to ensure thorough testing, design, and implementation.

## Workflow Process

### 0. Initial Setup

**In the main agent**: Create a new git worktree for the task. Memorize the name of the worktree.

```bash
git worktree add -b feature/task-name ../task-name-worktree
cd ../task-name-worktree
```

### 1. Test Requirement Evaluation

Create a new agent for the task using the Task tool to evaluate the need for tests:

1. **If it is a refactoring**: Evaluate if it needs new tests
2. **If it is a cleanup** or something that does not require new tests: Consider it does not need new tests  
3. **If it is a bug fix or a new feature**: New tests are required

### 2. Testing Phase (If tests are needed)

#### 2.1 Unit Tests Design

1. **In a new agent** (using the Task tool to create this agent): Design and document design of unit tests
2. **In a new agent** (using the Task tool to create this agent): Review design, especially if it handles the task at hand and edge cases
   - *Looping between 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 if needed, two new agents (Task tool) per loop round*
3. Run `/compact` to compact the context window, remember the task, the worktree name, the unit test design, and the step number you are working on

#### 2.2 Unit Tests Plan

1. **In a new agent** (using the Task tool to create this agent): Plan unit tests for the task based on design
2. **In a new agent** (using the Task tool to create this agent): Review plan
   - *Looping between 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 if needed, two new agents (Task tool) per loop round*
3. Run `/compact` to compact the context window, remember the task, the worktree name, the unit test plan, the unit test design, and the step number you are working on

#### 2.3 Tests Writing

1. **In a new agent** (using the Task tool to create this agent): Write unit tests, it is ok to be failing now

2. **If there is no comment**, or if the latest Claude comment is that it failed to run: Wait for user input and try again after user grants permission
3. **If there are comments**:
   1. **In a new agent** (using the Task tool to create this agent): Parse the latest Claude comment
   2. **If there are issues to address**:
      1. **In a new agent** (using the Task tool to create this agent): Create two check lists:
         1. Issues to address NOW
         2. Issues to address LATER in a follow-up PR
      2. **While the list of Issues to address LATER is not empty**:
         1. Ask user if they want to create a GitHub issue for the FIRST issue in the list of Issues to address LATER, if yes:
            1. **In a new agent** (using the Task tool to create this agent): Write a GitHub issue text for the FIRST issue
            2. **In a new agent** (using the Task tool to create this agent): Review the GitHub issue text
            3. **In this main agent**: Create a GitHub issue for this issue
         2. Remove the issue from the list of Issues to address LATER
         3. Run `/compact` to compact the context window, remember the task, the worktree name, the two lists of issues, and the step number you are working on
      3. Mark the latest Claude comment as closed
      4. **If the list of issues to address NOW is not empty**:
         1. Ask user which they want to be addressed NOW, which should be ignored and which should be done later:
            1. Replace the old list of issues to address NOW with the new list of issues to address NOW
            2. If the new list of issues to address LATER is not empty go back to step 6.4.3.2.2
            3. Ignore the list of ignored issues
         2. Run `/compact` to compact the context window, remember the list of issues to address NOW, the worktree name, and the step number you are working on
         3. Restart the process from step 1 with the list of issues to address NOW as the new task
   3. **If there are no more issues to address**:
      1. Merge the PR

### 7. Closing the Task

1. **If there is a GitHub issue**: Mark it as complete
2. **In a new agent** (using the Task tool to create this agent): Mark the task as complete if there is a roadmap document, task list, or similar for it
3. Exclude worktree from the git worktree list
4. Run `/clear` to clear the context window

## Important Notes

### Context Management

- Use `/compact` regularly to manage context window size
- Always remember the current task, worktree name, and step number
- Preserve important design decisions and test plans across agent switches

### Agent Usage

- Each design, review, and implementation step should use a dedicated agent via the Task tool
- Allow for iterative loops between design and review phases
- Maintain clear handoffs between agents with sufficient context

### Quality Assurance

- Tests are written before implementation (TDD approach)
- Multiple review cycles ensure quality
- Design-code alignment is validated
- Refactoring opportunities are systematically evaluated

### Integration

- This workflow integrates with existing Git and GitHub processes
- Follows conventional commit and branch naming standards
- Supports automated issue tracking and project management

## Compliance

**This workflow MUST be followed for all coding tasks** to ensure:

1. Consistent code quality
2. Comprehensive test coverage
3. Proper documentation and design
4. Effective collaboration and review processes
5. Maintainable and robust software solutions
