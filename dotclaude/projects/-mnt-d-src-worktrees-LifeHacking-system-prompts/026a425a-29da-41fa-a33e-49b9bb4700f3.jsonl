You should receive an invite from CodeSignal shortly; if you don't see it in your inbox today, please let us know. Please note that the link expires in one month, but we strongly encourage you to complete the assessment within 2 weeks if at all possible. \n\nThe CodeSignal platform will give you a choice of coding language, but we ask that you take the test in any of these languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Ruby, Java, and C++. We will not consider results submitted in other languages. The test time limit is 90 minutes. If you choose to complete the test in Java, the Java code will be wrapped into a larger class wrapper.\n \nThe CodeSignal screen is intended to test your ability to quickly and correctly write and refactor working code. You will not be evaluated on code quality. You’ll be asked to implement a simple coding project from a spec, broken into four levels. Your code will need to pass all tests in a given level to move forward to the next level. For many candidates, the later levels take more time to complete than the earlier ones. You should prioritize progressing through all four levels quickly, and getting as many tests as possible to pass if you are not able to complete a level.\n \nThe project will be a toy simulation of an app that won't require anything except the standard library of your chosen programming language. Note there's no framework/UI or anything similar — basically, it's like the core business logic of an app, but nothing else. It won’t test detailed knowledge of algorithms, compute systems, or machine learning.\n \nPlease do your work only within the CodeSignal platform, and do not use an external IDE or editor.

You should receive an invite from CodeSignal shortly; if you don't see it in your inbox today, please let us know. Please note that the link expires in one month, but we strongly encourage you to complete the assessment within 2 weeks if at all possible. \n\nThe CodeSignal platform will give you a choice of coding language, but we ask that you take the test in any of these languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Ruby, Java, and C++. We will not consider results submitted in other languages. The test time limit is 90 minutes. If you choose to complete the test in Java, the Java code will be wrapped into a larger class wrapper.\n \nThe CodeSignal screen is intended to test your ability to quickly and correctly write and refactor working code. You will not be evaluated on code quality. You'll be asked to implement a simple coding project from a spec, broken into four levels. Your code will need to pass all tests in a given level to move forward to the next level. For many candidates, the later levels take more time to complete than the earlier ones. You should prioritize progressing through all four levels quickly, and getting as many tests as possible to pass if you are not able to complete a level.\n \nThe project will be a toy simulation of an app that won't require anything except the standard library of your chosen programming language. Note there's no framework/UI or anything similar — basically, it's like the core business logic of an app, but nothing else. It won't test detailed knowledge of algorithms, compute systems, or machine learning.\n \nPlease do your work only within the CodeSignal platform, and do not use an external IDE or editor. You are not allowed to use Github Copilot or other LLMs, or copy code that solves the problem from a web resource or book. This will result in a failing score. You may consult web resources or books for specific technical questions, for example, to look up language documentation.\n \nLet me know if you have any questions!\n \nBest,\nJake\"\n\nPlease read the /jobs/new-history command file to understand what it should do and execute it accordingly.

You should receive an invite from CodeSignal shortly; if you don't see it in your inbox today, please let us know. Please note that the link expires in one month, but we strongly encourage you to complete the assessment within 2 weeks if at all possible.\n\n      The CodeSignal platform will give you a choice of coding language, but we ask that you take the test in any of these languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Ruby, Java, and C++. We will not consider results submitted in other languages. The test time limit is 90 minutes. If you choose to complete the test in Java, the Java code will be wrapped into a larger class wrapper.\n\n      The CodeSignal screen is intended to test your ability to quickly and correctly write and refactor working code. You will not be evaluated on code quality. You'll be asked to implement a simple coding project from a spec, broken into four levels. Your code will need to pass all tests in a given level to move forward to the next level. For many candidates, the later levels take more time to complete than the earlier ones. You should prioritize progressing through all four levels quickly, and getting as many tests as possible to pass if you are not able to complete a level.\n\n      The project will be a toy simulation of an app that won't require anything except the standard library of your chosen programming language. Note there's no framework/UI or anything similar — basically, it's like the core business logic of an app, but nothing else. It won't test detailed knowledge of algorithms, compute systems, or machine learning.\n\n      Please do your work only within the CodeSignal platform, and do not use an external IDE or editor. You are not allowed to use Github Copilot or other LLMs, or copy code that solves the problem from a web resource or book. This will result in a failing score.

The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. Initial local commands executed by the user:\n   - `/doctor` - no output\n   - `/memory` - opened memory file at ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md\n   - `/status` - no output  \n   - `/model` - set model to opusplan (claude-opus-4-1-20250805)\n\n2. User's first explicit request:\n   - \"hy aren't my user's custom slash commands not working?\"\n   - This appears to be a typo for \"Why aren't my user's custom slash commands working?\"\n   - User is having trouble with custom slash commands in Claude Code\n\n3. My investigation approach:\n   - Created a todo item to track the investigation\n   - Searched for Claude configuration files\n   - Found and read settings.local.json in the project directory\n   - Discovered empty project-level commands directory (.claude/commands/)\n   - Found global commands at /home/joaod/.claude/commands/\n   - Identified the distinction between project-level vs global commands\n\n4. Key findings:\n   - Project directory: /mnt/d/src/worktrees/LifeHacking/system-prompts/\n   - Project-level commands directory is empty\n   - Global commands exist in /home/joaod/.claude/commands/ with subdirectories:\n     - docs/ (containing download.md)\n     - jobs/ (containing eval-cover-letter.md, eval-cover-letterv2.md, improve-cover-letter.md, new-history.md, overlap-analysis.md)\n\n5. User's second request:\n   - \"/jobs/new-history\" followed by an email from Anthropic\n   - This was the user attempting to use one of the custom slash commands\n   - The email was an interview invitation from Jake Kartes at Anthropic for a Senior Software Engineer, Search position\n\n6. My execution of the command:\n   - Used the Task tool to execute the /jobs/new-history command\n   - The command successfully parsed the email and created:\n     - job-hunting/history/anthropic-jake.yaml\n     - job-hunting/input/anthropic-jake.yaml\n   - Extracted key details like company, position, recruiter, and timeline\n\n7. User's third request:\n   - Request for a detailed summary of the conversation\n   - This is the current task being addressed\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user initially asked why their custom slash commands weren't working in Claude Code. After I explained that global commands should be working and listed available commands, the user then attempted to use the `/jobs/new-history` command with an Anthropic interview invitation email, demonstrating that the commands were indeed functional. The user's intent was first to troubleshoot command functionality, then to use a specific command to process a job-related email.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Claude Code custom slash commands\n   - Project-level vs global command directories\n   - YAML file structure for job tracking\n   - Claude Code configuration (settings.local.json)\n   - Command file structure (.md files)\n   - Todo tracking system\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `/mnt/d/src/worktrees/LifeHacking/system-prompts/.claude/settings.local.json`\n      - Claude Code project configuration file\n      - Contains permissions and output style settings\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"permissions\": {\n          \"allow\": [\n            \"Read(//home/joaod/.claude/agents/**)\"\n          ]\n        },\n        \"outputStyle\": \"default\"\n      }\n      ```\n   \n   - `/home/joaod/.claude/commands/` (global commands directory)\n      - Contains custom slash commands available across all projects\n      - Subdirectories: docs/, jobs/\n   \n   - `/home/joaod/.claude/commands/jobs/new-history.md`\n      - Custom command for processing job-related communications\n      - Successfully executed to parse Anthropic email\n   \n   - `job-hunting/history/anthropic-jake.yaml` (created)\n      - Full interaction history for Anthropic opportunity\n   \n   - `job-hunting/input/anthropic-jake.yaml` (created)\n      - Structured input data for job tracking workflow\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - No explicit errors were encountered\n   - Initial confusion about commands not working was resolved by identifying that:\n     - Project-level commands directory was empty\n     - Global commands were available and functional\n     - User successfully used `/jobs/new-history` command, proving functionality\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Diagnosed why user thought commands weren't working (empty project-level directory vs populated global directory)\n   - Successfully executed the `/jobs/new-history` command to process the Anthropic interview invitation\n   - Extracted and structured job opportunity data into YAML format for workflow tracking\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"hy aren't my user's custom slash commands not working?\"\n   - \"/jobs/new-history Anthropic Automated Interview Invitation - João Marco Maciel da Silva | Senior Software Engineer, Search [followed by full email content]\"\n   - \"Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far...\" [current summary request]\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - None explicitly requested beyond the current summary\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Just completed executing the `/jobs/new-history` command which successfully parsed an Anthropic interview invitation email from Jake Kartes. The command created structured YAML files (anthropic-jake.yaml) in both the history and input directories of the job-hunting system. The email was for a Senior Software Engineer, Search position and included details about a CodeSignal technical screening with specific requirements (90 minutes, specific languages allowed, 2-week recommended completion timeframe).\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   No immediate next step required. The user successfully used the custom slash command they were inquiring about, and the job opportunity data has been properly structured and saved. The current task of providing a summary is now complete.."},"isVisibleInTranscriptOnly":true,"isCompactSummary":true,"uuid":"e87c9c9a-7979-4704-9c03-4a44569bcd7b","timestamp":"2025-09-18T07:46:58.616Z"}

You should receive an invite from CodeSignal shortly; if you don't see it in your inbox today, please let us know. Please note that the link expires in one month, but we strongly encourage you to complete the assessment within 2 weeks if at all possible.\n\n      The CodeSignal platform will give you a choice of coding language, but we ask that you take the test in any of these languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Ruby, Java, and C++. We will not consider results submitted in other languages. The test time limit is 90 minutes. If you choose to complete the test in Java, the Java code will be wrapped into a larger class wrapper.\n\n      The CodeSignal screen is intended to test your ability to quickly and correctly write and refactor working code. You will not be evaluated on code quality. You'll be asked to implement a simple coding project from a spec, broken into four levels. Your code will need to pass all tests in a given level to move forward to the next level. For many candidates, the later levels take more time to complete than the earlier ones. You should prioritize progressing through all four levels quickly, and getting as many tests as possible to pass if you are not able to complete a level.\n\n      The project will be a toy simulation of an app that won't require anything except the standard library of your chosen programming language. Note there's no framework/UI or anything similar — basically, it's like the core business logic of an app, but nothing else. It won't test detailed knowledge of algorithms, compute systems, or machine learning.\n\n      Please do your work only within the CodeSignal platform, and do not use an external IDE or editor. You are not allowed to use Github Copilot or other LLMs, or copy code that solves the problem from a web resource or book. This will result in a failing score.
