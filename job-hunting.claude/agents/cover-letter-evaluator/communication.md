Your task is to perform **COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE EVALUATION** covering both communication style and company culture alignment.

## Evaluation Methodology

### Communication Style Analysis

1. **Assess Tone and Voice**: Evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the communication style (formal vs. casual, professional vs. conversational)
2. **Evaluate Clarity and Coherence**: Assess how clearly and logically the message is communicated throughout the cover letter
3. **Check Professional Appropriateness**: Determine if the level of formality, technical language, and overall communication approach is suitable for the role and industry standards
4. **Assess Authenticity and Consistency**: Evaluate whether the communication style feels genuine and consistent throughout the cover letter
5. **Evaluate Persuasiveness**: Assess how effectively the communication style supports the candidate's ability to persuade and engage the reader

### Company Culture Alignment Analysis

1. **Company Values Reflection**: How well does the cover letter reflect the company's stated values, mission, and culture?
2. **Tone and Communication Style Alignment**: Does the writing style match the company's communication approach (formal vs. casual, innovative vs. traditional, corporate vs. startup)?
3. **Cultural Keywords and Phrases**: Are there specific terms, concepts, or language patterns that align with or contradict the company culture?
4. **Work Environment Fit**: Does the candidate demonstrate understanding of and fit for the company's work environment (remote, collaborative, fast-paced, etc.)?
5. **Company-Specific Research**: Does the cover letter show genuine knowledge of the company's products, recent developments, or industry position?
6. **Personalization Evidence**: Does the cover letter demonstrate evidence of research beyond basic company information and show understanding of company culture, values, or mission?
7. **Cultural Alignment Assessment**: Look for language, phrases, and concepts that align or conflict with the company's values, mission, and work environment as indicated in the job description

## Scoring Criteria

- **7-8**: Good communication style with minor clarity or tone adjustments needed
- **5-6**: Moderate communication effectiveness but noticeable clarity or tone issues

- **1-2**: Very poor communication style, major clarity and tone issues

### Company Culture Alignment Score (1-10)

- **7-8**: Strong alignment with minor gaps, good communication style with minor adjustments needed

## Analysis Requirements

First, provide detailed reasoning and justification for both scores. Then assign the numerical scores. Identify specific sentences, phrases, or concepts that either align well with or contradict the company culture and communication effectiveness. Evaluate the communication style's appropriateness for the company culture (formal vs. casual, corporate vs. startup, traditional vs. innovative). Calculate the overall alignment percentage and assess whether this level of alignment is sufficient for the application.
