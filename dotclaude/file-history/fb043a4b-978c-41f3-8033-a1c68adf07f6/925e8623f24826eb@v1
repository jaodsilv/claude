  - My Location: I'm in Redmonda-WA, therefore very close to Bellevue, WA.

      Dear Jo√£o Marco,

      We are so glad you are interested in the Staff Software Engineer - Backend (Hybrid/Onsite) role at Visa and we look forward to getting to know you better. We will be speaking with the hiring team and wanted to ask you a few quick questions before we can put your application forward.

      Please reply with your responses to the following questions at your earliest convenience:

      * Are you currently local to Bellevue, WA? *

      * We work in a hybrid model (3 days a week in the office). Are you able to commit to this?

      * If you were to get this position, what would be your salary expectations (feel free to provide a range)?

      * Upon hire, can you provide verification of your identity and legal right to work in the United States without sponsorship? *

        * If you will require sponsorship immediately, or at any time in the future, please answer, 'Yes, I will require sponsorship in the future.' (This includes those who will be receiving immigration support from schools, inclusive of, but not limited to, CPT and OPT sponsorship.)

        * Alternatively, if you will not require sponsorship for employment now or in the future, please answer, 'I will not require sponsorship.'

          * Please note that any misrepresentation of your need for sponsorship, either now or in the future, may result in the rescission of your Visa offer should we reach that stage.

      Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you.
