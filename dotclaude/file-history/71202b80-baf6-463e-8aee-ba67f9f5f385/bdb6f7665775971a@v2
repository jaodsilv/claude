# Interview Preparation - Implementation Tasks

**Repository**: https://github.com/jaodsilv/interview-prep (to be created)
**Status**: Repository needs to be created and initialized
**Visibility**: PRIVATE

## Overview

This repository will contain technical interview preparation materials including cheat sheets, system design diagrams, algorithm visualizations, API design guides, database references, and company-specific interview guides.

## Source Locations

1. **Primary Source**: `D:/src/tmp/Coding Interview/` (~54 image files + 1 PDF)
2. **Secondary Source**: `D:/src/WEB/` (Uber interview guide + related files)

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Repository Creation on GitHub

```bash
"C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" repo create jaodsilv/interview-prep --private --description "Technical interview preparation materials: cheat sheets, system design diagrams, and company-specific guides"
```

### 2. Repository Initialization

Initialize the local repository structure with organized directories:

```bash
cd D:/src
mkdir -p interview-prep
cd interview-prep
git init
git branch -M main

# Create organized directory structure
mkdir -p cheat-sheets
mkdir -p system-design
mkdir -p api-design
mkdir -p databases
mkdir -p algorithms
mkdir -p company-guides
mkdir -p certificates
mkdir -p study-plans
```

### 3. Content Transfer and Organization

Transfer content from both source locations and organize by topic:

```bash
# First, examine files to categorize them properly
cd "D:/src/tmp/Coding Interview"
ls -la

# Transfer files to appropriate directories based on naming
# (This step should be done carefully, examining each file)

# Copy all to interview-prep temporarily
cd D:/src/interview-prep
cp -r "../tmp/Coding Interview/"* ./temp/

# Manually organize files into appropriate directories
# Examples:
# - *api* files → api-design/
# - *database* files → databases/
# - *system* files → system-design/
# - *algorithm* files → algorithms/
# - *.pdf → certificates/

# Transfer WEB content
cp "../WEB/Uber Careers _ Backend Engineering Interview Guide.md" ./company-guides/uber-backend-guide.md
cp ../WEB/times.* ./company-guides/

# Clean up temporary directory
rm -rf temp/
```

**Important**: Files should be manually categorized during transfer based on content:
- API architectural styles → api-design/
- CAP theorem, microservices → system-design/
- Database types, decision trees → databases/
- Bloom filter, algorithms → algorithms/
- Coding cheat sheets → cheat-sheets/
- Company guides → company-guides/
- Certificates → certificates/

### 4. Create .gitignore

Create appropriate `.gitignore` file:

```gitignore
# Personal notes and annotations
notes/
personal/
annotations/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Editor files
*.swp
*.swo
*~
.vscode/
.idea/

# Temporary files
temp/
tmp/
.snapshots/

# Study progress tracking (if added later)
progress.json
study-log.md
```

### 5. Create README.md

Document the interview preparation repository:

```markdown
# Technical Interview Preparation

Private repository containing curated technical interview preparation materials including cheat sheets, system design diagrams, algorithm visualizations, and company-specific interview guides.
