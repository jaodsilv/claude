## Environment Setup

## Project Management

<!-- TODO: Add project management -->
- **Project Board**: [{{project-board-name}}]({{project-board-url}})
- **Development Plan**: See `.claude/shared/todo.md` for high-level roadmap with issue links. Exists only in this branch. Do not attempt to read from other branches or worktrees
- **Issue Creation**: Use GitHub issue templates for consistent reporting
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions automatically add labeled issues/PRs to project board. See `.github/workflows/add-issues-to-project.yml`

## Architecture Overview

## Development Notes

### Code Style

### Security Considerations
- API keys loaded from environment variables only
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- `.{{env-file-name}}` file excluded from version control
- **API Key Validation**: Verify API key format and test connectivity on startup
- **Error Handling**: Implement graceful handling of API failures and rate limits
- **API Key Rotation**: Update `.{{env-file-name}}` file when rotating keys, restart application to apply changes
{{project-specific-security-considerations}}

### Testing and Linting
- ESLint configured with {{framework}} app presets
- **Testing Framework**: {{testing-framework}}
- **Test Coverage Target**: >{{test-coverage-target}}% coverage for production readiness
- **Testing Strategy**: TDD for any task associated to a GitHub issue. Unit tests for components/hooks, integration tests for workflows, E2E tests for critical paths.
- **Linting**: {{linting}}
- **Typechecking**: {{typechecking}}
{{project-specific-testing-and-linting}}
- **Testing Running**: Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance

### Issue Tracking and Development Plan
- **Issue Tracking**: All features tracked as GitHub issues linked to development phases
- **Project Management**: Automated GitHub Actions workflow for issue/PR management
- **Phase-Based Development**: See issues [{{project-issues-url}}]({{project-issues-url}}) and @.claude/shared/todo.md for detailed implementation plan
- **Priority Levels**: Critical â†’ High â†’ Medium â†’ Low (automatically set via issue labels)
- **Status Automation**: Issues/PRs automatically move through Todo â†’ In Progress â†’ Done states

### Development Workflow
1. Launch the `task-picker` agent to pick a task to work on. Described in ~/.claude/agents/task-picker.md
2. Launch the `task-manager` agent to manage the task and start other agents and start the rest of the workflow. Described in ~/.claude/agents/task-manager.md

### Git Guidelines

#### Branch Naming

Read @.claude/instructions/conventional-branch.md for more details.

#### Commit Conventions

- **Basics**: Read @.claude/instructions/conventional-commits.md for more details.
- **Focused Commits**: Only commit files directly related to your current task or change
- **Staging Discipline**: Use `git add` selectively to stage only relevant files, not `git add .`
- **Unrelated Changes**: Keep unrelated changes (one-time testing files, config updates, etc.) in separate commits
- **Clean History**: If you accidentally stage unrelated files, use `git restore --staged <file>` to unstage them. Do not use `git restore --staged .` to unstage all files.
- **Commit Scope**: Each commit should represent a single, cohesive change that can be reviewed independently. Do not commit changes that are not related to the current task.
- **Authoring**: Do NOT add "Co-authors", "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>" or "ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)" to the commit message.
