*.swo
*~
.vscode/
.idea/

# Temporary files
temp/
tmp/
.snapshots/

\```

## ATS Platform Research

The `top20.md` file contains comprehensive research comparing top ATS platforms:
- Market share data
- Feature comparisons
- Small company vs large company recommendations
- Data aggregated from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini

## Workflow Diagrams

Mermaid diagrams document the complete job application workflow:

1. **Company Research**: Research target companies
2. **Master Resume**: Maintain comprehensive resume
3. **JD Matching**: Match qualifications to job descriptions
4. **Tailoring**: Customize resume for specific roles
5. **Draft Writing**: Create initial application documents
6. **Polishing**: Refine and optimize content
7. **Pruning**: Remove unnecessary content

## Rendering Diagrams

To render mermaid diagrams:

\```bash
# Install mermaid-cli
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

# Render single diagram
mmdc -i company_research.mmd -o company_research.png

# Render all diagrams
for file in *.mmd; do
  mmdc -i "$file" -o "rendered/${file%.mmd}.png"
done
\```

mmdc --version

# If not installed, install it
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

# Validate all diagrams (optional - render to check syntax)
mkdir rendered
for file in *.mmd; do
  echo "Validating $file..."
  mmdc -i "$file" -o "rendered/${file%.mmd}.png" || echo "Error in $file"
done
```
