You should receive an invite from CodeSignal shortly; if you don't see it in your inbox today, please let us know. Please note that the link expires in one month, but we strongly encourage you to complete the assessment within 2 weeks if at all possible.\n\n      The CodeSignal platform will give you a choice of coding language, but we ask that you take the test in any of these languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Ruby, Java, and C++. We will not consider results submitted in other languages. The test time limit is 90 minutes. If you choose to complete the test in Java, the Java code will be wrapped into a larger class wrapper.\n\n      The CodeSignal screen is intended to test your ability to quickly and correctly write and refactor working code. You will not be evaluated on code quality. You'll be asked to implement a simple coding project from a spec, broken into four levels. Your code will need to pass all tests in a given level to move forward to the next level. For many candidates, the later levels take more time to complete than the earlier ones. You should prioritize progressing through all four levels quickly, and getting as many tests as possible to pass if you are not able to complete a level.\n\n      The project will be a toy simulation of an app that won't require anything except the standard library of your chosen programming language. Note there's no framework/UI or anything similar — basically, it's like the core business logic of an app, but nothing else. It won't test detailed knowledge of algorithms, compute systems, or machine learning.\n\n      Please do your work only within the CodeSignal platform, and do not use an external IDE or editor.
