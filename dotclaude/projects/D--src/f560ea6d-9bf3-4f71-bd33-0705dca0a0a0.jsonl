Your task is to analyze existing git repositories and create a comprehensive restructuring plan to improve modularity, naming conventions, and visibility settings.\n\nHere are the repositories you need to analyze:\n\n<repositories>\n* ./LifeHackingScripts\n* ./ai-message-writer-assistant\n* ./claude\n* ./ai-job-seeking-claude-code\n</repositories>\n\nYour goal is to create a complete restructuring plan that reorganizes these repositories for better maintainability and appropriate access control.\n\nBefore creating your restructuring plan, work through your analysis systematically in <analysis> tags inside your thinking block. Think of this analysis as being conducted by separate specialized subagents, each handling a distinct sequential phase. It's OK for this section to be quite long.\n\n**Phase 1 - Repository Inventory Subagent**: Write down each repository path explicitly, numbering them to ensure you're working with the complete set.\n\n**Phase 2 - Project Identification Subagent**: For each repository path, systematically identify what distinct projects likely exist based on the path names, directory structure, and naming patterns. Write down each identified project with the specific evidence from the repository path/structure that supports this identification. Create a comprehensive numbered list of all identified projects.\n\n**Phase 3 - Branch/Worktree Analysis Subagent**: Consider what local branches and worktrees might exist that contain different project variations or development states. Write down any potential implications for the restructuring.\n\n**Phase 4 - Naming Analysis Subagent**: Evaluate current naming conventions and write down explicit lists: (a) projects with clear, appropriate names, and (b) projects that need improved naming to make their purposes clearer. For each project needing renaming, note the specific naming issues.\n\n**Phase 5 - Conflict Detection Subagent**: Create explicit numbered lists of: (a) projects with similar names, (b) projects with overlapping functionality, and (c) potential duplicates that need resolution. Write down the specific conflicts for each.\n\n**Phase 6 - Visibility Assessment Subagent**: Go through each identified project and write down whether it should be public or private, along with your reasoning based on the apparent nature and content.\n\n**Phase 7 - Custom Tooling Requirements Subagent**: For each identified project, systematically write down what custom slash commands, agents, and workflows would be most beneficial based on the project type and likely use cases.\n\nAfter completing your analysis, provide a structured restructuring plan with the following sections:\n\n**Repository Analysis**\n- List each current repository and the distinct projects identified within it\n- Note any special considerations for branches or worktrees\n\n**Naming Recommendations**\n- Propose improved names for projects that need clearer, more descriptive naming\n- Explain the reasoning behind naming changes\n\n**Conflict Resolution**\n- Identify any naming conflicts, duplicates, or overlapping projects\n- Provide specific strategies for resolving each conflict\n\n**Custom Tooling Strategy**\n- For each project, recommend appropriate custom slash commands, agents, and workflows\n- Explain how these tools would benefit the specific project type\n\n**New Repository Commands**\n- Provide exact `gh repo create` commands for each new repository needed\n- Specify public or private visibility for each repository\n\n**Transfer Plan**\n- Step-by-step instructions for moving code from existing repositories to new ones\n- Specify which files and directories belong to each project\n\n**Git Commands**\n- Specific git commands needed to commit and push the new repositories\n- Focus only on commands for new repositories, not removals from existing ones\n\nYour plan should be actionable and include all necessary command-line instructions that can be executed step-by-step to achieve the restructuring goals.\n\nExample output structure:\n\n**Repository Analysis**\n- Repository: /path/to/example-repo\n  - Project Alpha: Web application for user management\n  - Project Beta: CLI tool for data processing\n- Repository: /path/to/another-repo\n  - Project Gamma: Machine learning model training scripts\n\n**Naming Recommendations**\n- Current: old-util-thing → Proposed: data-processing-cli (Reason: clarifies purpose and scope)\n\n**Conflict Resolution**\n- Issue: Two projects with similar data processing functionality\n- Resolution: Merge overlapping features into unified tool\n\n**Custom Tooling Strategy**\n- Project Name:\n  - Slash Commands: /deploy, /test (Purpose: streamline common operations)\n  - Agents: CI/CD automation agent\n  - Workflows: Pull request validation, automated testing\n\n**New Repository Commands**\n```bash\ngh repo create organization/example-repo-name --public\ngh repo create organization/another-example --private\n```\n\n**Transfer Plan**\n1. Create new repository structure\n2. Copy relevant files from source to destination\n3. Update configuration files\n\n**Git Commands**\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit for restructured repository\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nYour final output should consist only of the structured restructuring plan and should not duplicate or rehash any of the analysis work you completed in the thinking block."},"uuid":"3337a8d4-d699-4f72-905d-b41f6ff2b553","timestamp":"2025-10-14T21:27:55.258Z","thinkingMetadata":{"level":"high","disabled":false,"triggers":[]}}
