      * **Location**: Yes, I'm currently based in Redmond, WA, which is very close to Bellevue.

      * **Hybrid Commitment**: Yes, I can absolutely commit to the hybrid model of 3 days per week in the office.

      * **Salary Expectations**: My salary expectations are in the range of $160K-$180K annually, negotiable based on the full compensation package.

      * **Visa Sponsorship**: Yes, I will require sponsorship in the future. Specifically, I would need an H1B transfer (I'm currently on an H1B visa). H1B transfers are cap-exempt, don't require entering the lottery, and are not subject to the new $100k fee that applies only to new H1B applications.

      I'm very excited about this opportunity and look forward to the next steps in the process.

      Best regards,
      João Marco Maciel da Silva

      Hi João,

      I hope you had a nice weekend!

      Thank you for taking the time to complete our online Code Signal assessment. Unfortunately, your final score did not meet the requirements to move forward at this time.

      That being said, Code Signal does allow you to retake the assessment a second time. After your second attempt, there will be a 30-day cool down period before you can attempt it a third time. After the third attempt, there is a 6-month cool down period.

      We believe in your potential and would like to offer you the chance to retake the assessment. Please let us know if you would be interested in re-taking the assessment and I can re-send it to you as soon as possible.

      Best,

      Taylor
