Your code will need to pass all tests in a given level to move forward to the next level. For many candidates, the later levels take more time to complete than the earlier ones.

Your primary responsibility is to process raw recruiter messages from LinkedIn and email, extract all relevant information, and generate properly formatted YAML files for job hunting workflow management.\n\n## Task\n\nYour task is to create 2 files:\n\n* A new history file in the @job-hunting/history directory.\n* A new input file in the @job-hunting/input directory.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Parse the arguments to extract the desired information\n2. analyze the arguments to determine the best template to use\n3. analyze the arguments to extract non-obvious information, like the datetime of the message and company name\n4. Create the history file\n5. Create the input file\n\n### Arguments Parsing\n\nYou should parse the arguments to extract the following information:\n\n* The company name, either from the person's title or from the message body\n* The recruiting company name (for contract positions), either from the person's title or from the message body\n* The recruiter's name\n* If it is a contract or a Full Time position from the message body\n* The date and time of the message, if it is only a day of the week or a hours ago calculate the datetime it was received.\n  Note that it is always presented in the -07:00 timezone, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n* Subject of the message (if available)\n* The message body\n\n#### Input format\n\nBelow are texts written in mixed of regex and text., like a regex using python's f-string format for variables.\nIf multiple messages arrived, they are separated by a triple dash `\\n---\\n`.\nIt comes in one of the following formats:\n\n##### Format 1 - LinkedIn\n\n* Note that, sometimes, the person includes their company in their title, like \"Talent Partner@ Amazon Robotics\".\n* In that case, you should extract the company name from the title.\n* Gender pronouns are optional\n* \"\\nVerified recruiter\" is optional\n* \", #HIRING\" is optional\n* \"\\n👏\\n👍\\n😊\\n+\" is optional\n* \"{{subject}}\\n\" is optional\n* \"\\n{2,}{{attachment_filename}}\\n\\n{{attachment_size}}\\n\\nDownload\" is optional\n* You should infer the desired variables from the text.\n\n```text\n{{full_name}}(\\n\\({{gender_pronouns}}\\))?\\n{{degree_connection}} degree connection\\n· {{degree_connection}}\\n{{person_title}}\\n(\\nVerified recruiter)?\\n{{day_of_week_or_date}}\\n{{full_name}} sent the following messages at {{time}}\\nView {{first_name}}’s profile{{full_name}}(, #HIRING)?\\n{{full_name}}( \\({{gender_pronouns}}\\))?  {{time}}(\\n👏\\n👍\\n😊\\n+)?\\n+({{subject}}\\n)?{{message_body}}(\\n{2,}{{attachment_filename}}\\n\\n{{attachment_size}}\\n\\nDownload)?\n```\n\n##### Format 2 - Email\n\n* \"{{labels_names}}\" is optional\n* You should infer the desired variables from the text.\n\n```text\n{{subject}}\\n({{labels_names}})?\\n\\n{{from}} <{{email_address}}>\\n{{datetime_info}}\\nto {{João}}\\n\\n{{message_body}}\n```\n\n### History File\n\nCreate a new history file in the @job-hunting/history directory.\n\n#### History File Filename\n\nThe filename should be in the format of `<company_name>-<recruiter_first_name>.yaml` for full time positions\nor `<recruiting_company_name>-<recruiter_first_name>-<company_name>.yaml` for contract positions.\n\nIf either the company name or the recruiting company name is unknown, use the word `unknown` in its place.\n\n#### History File Content\n\nThe generated content should follow one of the templates below:\n\n##### Template Group 1 - LinkedIn\n\n* Note that `optional_subject` is optional\n* `timestamp` should be printed in ISO format with the day of the week after it, e.g., `2025-08-20T15:21:00-07:00 Wednesday`\n* Datetimes are always in -07:00 timezone\n\n###### Template Group 1.1 - Reach-Out for contract positions\n\n####### Template 1.1.1 - Without company name\n\n```yaml\ncontext:\n  - Approaches with no company name usually seems fishy to me, but I'm ok with that.\n  - 70/hour is in the lower range of my acceptable range, but it is still inside.
