### Git Guidelines

#### Branch Naming

Read @.claude/shared/docs/conventional-branch.md for more details.

#### Commit Conventions

- **Basics**: Read @.claude/shared/docs/conventional-commits.md for more details.
- **Focused Commits**: Only commit files directly related to your current task or change
- **Staging Discipline**: Use `git add` selectively to stage only relevant files, not `git add .`
- **Unrelated Changes**: Keep unrelated changes (one-time testing files, config updates, etc.) in separate commits
- **Clean History**: If you accidentally stage unrelated files, use `git restore --staged <file>` to unstage them. Do not use `git restore --staged .` to unstage all files.
- **Commit Scope**: Each commit should represent a single, cohesive change that can be reviewed independently. Do not commit changes that are not related to the current task.
- **Authoring**: Do NOT add "Co-authors", "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>" or "ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)" to the commit message.

### Versioning

- **Basics**: Read @.claude/shared/docs/semver.md for more details.
- **Versioning Strategy**: Use semantic versioning (SemVer) for all new releases.
- **Version Management**: Use the `version` command to manage the version of the project.
- **Version File**: The version is stored in the `version.txt` file.
- **Version Tag**: The version is tagged with the `v` prefix.
- **Version History**: The version history is stored in the `version-history.md` file.
