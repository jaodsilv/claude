context:
  - Approaches with no company name usually seems fishy to me, but I'm ok with that.
  - 140k yearly is in the lower range of my acceptable range, but it is still inside. Below that I must reject. The higher the better.
  - Do not forget to mention that I require H1B Visa Sponsorship for any new position.
