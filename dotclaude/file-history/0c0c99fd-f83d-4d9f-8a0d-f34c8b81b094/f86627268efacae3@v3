## How to Find Your Old Content

If you're looking for something that was in LifeHackingScripts:

1. **LaTeX/resume/cover letter templates** → check `latex-templates`
2. **Filled application documents** → check `job-applications` (private)
3. **Python job hunting tools** → check `job-hunting-automation`
4. **Personal projects** → check respective repositories
5. **Prompt engineering content** → Still in this repo under review
6. **Learning projects** → Still in this repo under review

## Related Repositories

All new repositories are part of an improved organizational structure:

- **claude** - Claude Code configurations: https://github.com/jaodsilv/claude
- **ai-message-writer-assistant** - Communication assistant: https://github.com/jaodsilv/ai-message-writer-assistant

## Questions?

If you're looking for specific content and can't find it, check the migration map above or open an issue in the relevant new repository.

## Acknowledgments

git push origin main
```

### 6. Update Repository Settings on GitHub

**Via GitHub Web Interface:**

1. Go to repository settings
2. Update repository description: "⚠️ DEPRECATED - Restructured into specialized repositories. See DEPRECATED.md"
3. Add topics: `deprecated`, `archived`, `migration-complete`
4. Consider adding a custom repository social preview image with "DEPRECATED" text

### 7. Optional: Archive Repository

**If user decides to archive after review:**

Via GitHub web interface:
1. Settings → Danger Zone → Archive this repository
2. Confirm archival

**Note**: Only archive after completing review of PromptEngineering/, Learning/, and python/Training/

## Verification Steps

1. Verify DEPRECATED.md is comprehensive and accurate
2. Verify README.md shows deprecation notice
3. Verify issue template created
4. Verify badges display correctly
5. Verify commit message is clear
6. Test git push succeeds
7. Verify deprecation notice visible on GitHub
8. Verify repository description updated

## Notes

- **Don't delete yet**: Keep repository until PromptEngineering/ and Learning/ content reviewed
- **Historical value**: Repository shows evolution of tools and learning
- **Link preservation**: Existing links to this repo will still work
- **Search**: GitHub search will find the deprecation notice

## Success Criteria

- [ ] DEPRECATED.md created and comprehensive
- [ ] README.md updated with deprecation notice
- [ ] Issue template created
- [ ] Status badges added
- [ ] Changes committed with clear message
- [ ] Pushed to GitHub

2. Delete or archive remaining deprecated content
3. Decide whether to archive or delete the repository
4. Update DEPRECATED.md with final status
5. Add "FINAL STATUS" section documenting ultimate fate
