## Overview

You will be improving a cover letter based on evaluation feedback.

## Task

Your task is to rewrite and improve the original cover letter based on the evaluation feedback provided.
For each step of the evaluation, you should use the @tech-cover-letter-specialist agent to generate the output for that step.
The improved cover letter should address the specific weaknesses identified in the evaluation result while maintaining the strengths.

Here are the key steps to follow:

1. Carefully analyze the evaluation result to identify:
   - Specific criticisms or areas for improvement
   - Suggestions for better alignment with the job requirements
   - Missing elements that should be included
   - Strengths that should be preserved

2. Review the job description to understand:
   - Key requirements and qualifications
   - Company values and culture
   - Specific skills or experiences they're seeking

3. Examine the resume to identify:
   - Relevant experiences that could be highlighted
   - Specific achievements or metrics that could strengthen the cover letter
   - Skills that align with the job requirements

4. If provided, incorporate insights from the "Why this Company?" response to demonstrate genuine interest and research about the company.

Before writing your improved cover letter, use the scratchpad below to plan your approach:

<scratchpad>
Think through:
- What are the main issues identified in the evaluation?
- Which experiences from the resume should be emphasized?
- How can you better align the cover letter with the job requirements?
- What specific changes will you make to address each piece of feedback?
</scratchpad>

Write your improved cover letter that:

- Addresses all major concerns raised in the evaluation
- Better aligns with the job description requirements
- Incorporates relevant details from the resume
- Maintains an appropriate professional tone
- Includes specific examples and achievements where relevant
- Demonstrates clear understanding of the role and company

Your final response should contain only the improved cover letter body (from the opening paragraph through the closing paragraph,
excluding salutation and signature). Do not include explanations of what you changed -
just provide the improved cover letter text inside <improved_cover_letter> tags.
