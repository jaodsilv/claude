Let me break down what I need to do:\n\n1. Read the resume file (already read)\n2. Read the conversation history file (already read)\n3. Analyze the conversation and context\n4. Draft a response following the guidelines in the system prompt\n5. Since output_filepath is the same as conversation_history_filepath, I need to:\n   - Output all blocks EXCEPT <draft_response> to console\n   - Edit the conversation_history_filepath file to append the draft response in YAML format\n\nLet me analyze the conversation:\n\n**Context from the YAML:**\n- Salary expectations: Between 160k and 180k. Negotiable.\n- Location: Redmond-WA, very close to Bellevue, WA\n- Open to hybrid or onsite\n- Requires H1B sponsor transfer (not lottery, not the new 100k fee)\n- Platform: email\n- Process status: application response\n\n**Message from Taylor Preston:**\n- Timestamp: 2025-10-01T14:04:00-07:00 Tuesday\n- Questions:\n  1. Are you currently local to Bellevue, WA?\n  2. Can you commit to hybrid model (3 days a week in office)?\n  3. Salary expectations?\n  4. Do you require visa sponsorship?\n\n**Current datetime:** 2025-10-01T18:11:00-07:00 Tuesday\n\nSo the message was received at 14:04 (2:04 PM) and current time is 18:11 (6:11 PM) on the same day (Tuesday).\n\nNow let me think about the response timing strategy:\n\n**Timing Analysis:**\n- Message received: Tuesday 2:04 PM\n- Current time: Tuesday 6:11 PM\n- Time elapsed: ~4 hours\n\nFor an application response where the recruiter is asking screening questions, responding quickly shows:\n\n\nDemonstrating enthusiasm and prompt communication signals genuine interest in the opportunity. A well-timed response reflects professional courtesy and attentiveness. The timing suggests I'm actively engaged but not overly desperate, striking a balanced approach to professional communication.\n\nThe response strategy involves carefully calibrating the timing to showcase:\n- Genuine professional interest\n- Respectful and measured communication\n- Strategic engagement with the recruitment process\n\nResponding within a reasonable window communicates that I'm serious about the opportunity while maintaining a composed and professional demeanor. The goal is to create a positive first impression that highlights my communication skills and professional approach. I'll need to complete the partial thought first by copying over the next thinking, then I'll summarize:\n\nAn H1B transfer is different from a new H1B petition, which means I'll need to clearly explain my visa situation. I need a transfer of H1B sponsorship, avoiding the lottery process and any potential high-cost fees. This transfer is advantageous because it's cap-exempt and doesn't require going through the standard H1B application process.\n\nThe key points are straightforward: I require an H1B transfer, which is simpler and more direct than a new petition. I'll be transparent about my sponsorship needs, ensuring the recruiter understands the specific type of visa support I'm seeking.\n\nMy approach will focus on clear communication about my visa status, emphasizing the straightforward nature of an H1B transfer and my readiness to join the team.","signature":"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
