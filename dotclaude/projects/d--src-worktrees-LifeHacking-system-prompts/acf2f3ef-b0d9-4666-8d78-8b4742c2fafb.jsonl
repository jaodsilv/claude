Handling over 1 trillion queries per day, our platform operates at an unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, ownership, empathy, and collaboration. We value the unique experiences and perspectives that each person brings to The Trade Desk, and we are committed to fostering inclusive spaces where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work every day.\n\nDo you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally- connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small- to medium-sized workplaces globally.\n\n### What we do\n\nOur Senior Software Engineers are end-to-end owners who have the opportunity to participate in many aspects of designing, building, and delivering data-focused products for our stakeholders. \n\nAt The Trade Desk, we believe in building the back-end infrastructure of our platform with a focus on quality at scale. This means whether we are building parts of our client-facing applications, internal custom solutions for our own team members, or model pipelines for bidding optimizations, we are making sure that we have infrastructure, development, and tools to do it right and efficiently.\n\nThe Data Platform team is responsible for enabling the business to create powerful and efficient insights from data. In this role you will be working cross functionally with data engineers, data analysts, solution architects and business intelligence to design and implement optimized datasets that accelerate innovation. This team will also be responsible for building the framework and guardrails to make sure our datasets are high quality, compliant, and stable. Lastly you will be systemically identifying and implementing fundamental improvements to how we utilize data while fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.\n\nWe are a global team with different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be well-versed in building from common ground to value, seek out, and foster invisible and visible dimensions of diversity.\n\nAt The Trade Desk, we believe that each opportunity to engage with consumers is unique. This means user experience can make or break our business – our users must have all the flexibility to harness our system’s growing power and present meaningful insight from the petabytes of data streaming through our platform with unparalleled ease. \n\nOur system performs all day, every day, serving global traffic. We deliver features to improve the clients' abilities to make real-time decisions and troubleshoot campaigns with simple-to-use interfaces and high-performance data interactions. We work in a highly collaborative environment with user experience and product management organizations to ensure consistent, modern designs as well as the right balance of requirements to improve the users' day-to-day lives. Our front-end developers work up and down the stack (client to server) to deliver these world-class experiences. \n\n### What you’ll do:\n\nSome of the work that you will be doing to help us deliver on our mission:\n\n* Shaping the vision and execution of how we manage data across its lifecycle — from curated internal datasets to powering production features or privacy-centric exports for external partners.\n* Building solutions that will help enable data transparency throughout the org through establishing processing that improve our overall metadata and data lineage\n* Designing and owning core, foundational datasets that reduce redundant and costly downstream transformations across the data ecosystem.\n* Collaborating closely with Legal, Security, and Governance teams to ensure responsible and compliant usage of data as a steward of our internal data platform.\n* Helping define and uphold standards for data quality, observability, and lineage to increase trust and traceability across the organization.\n\nWe are a global team with different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be well-versed in building from common ground to value, seek out, and foster invisible and visible dimensions of diversity.\n\n### Who you are:\n\nOur culture is much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...). We take pride in our engineers being trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.

You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you & your team are doing.\n* You are a driver. You will be driving technical projects and providing leadership in a ground-breaking and fast-paced environment. This includes task planning and conducting code reviews, as well as individual code contribution.\n* You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work.\n* You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.\n* You are a broadly skilled engineer, accustomed to developing web services. You have experience building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers.\n* You have a product-focused mindset.

We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.\n* You are a creative thinker, not bound by \"the way things have always been done\". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.\n\nVariety of technical opportunity is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a software engineer which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and find solutions to complex problems using the optimum tools for the job. What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate.

Congratulations on making it to the next stage, you're invited to take the Industry Coding Framework Challenge which will test your skills across a broad range of fundamentals advancing through four progressive levels.  It's an interesting and engaging challenge which unlocks different levels as you work through the problem.\n\n      The test lasts a maximum of 90 minutes and the link will expire after two weeks.  This exercise is available in Python 3, C#, Go, Java, Kotlin, PHP, Ruby, C++, JavaScript and Typescript. Once you submit your test, it will be manually evaluated by our engineering team.\n\n      You should be receiving an e-mail with this challenge shortly.  Please use the link in the e-mail from CodeSignal and let me know if you don't receive the link.  If successful, the next stage in the process will be to have a call with me to go over more about the role, your background and any questions you may have.\n\n      To ensure you're set up for success, I'd like to share a few best practices for the most successful candidates:\n      Leverage the practice feature offered by CodeSignal to get familiar with the interface\n\n      Brush up on basics and ensure you're comfortable with operations such as sorting, string manipulation and building basic classes\n\n      Keep optimization, clean code and debugging in mind as you work through the activities\n\n      Our reviewers will be evaluating plagiarism flags from CodeSignal's automation, your ability to understand the requirements and code quality – including, but not limited to code reuse, use of efficient data structures & object oriented principles, and overall implementation efficiency\n\n      Time Management – this is a progressive test and you have 90 minutes to complete, so use your time wisely\n\n\n      Please let me know if you have any questions at this point and wishing you the best of luck with the challenge.
