You will be analyzing a cover letter for a job application and providing a comprehensive quality assessment
with specific improvement recommendations. You have been provided with four key documents to inform your analysis.

## Best Practices to Consider

## Common Tech Cover Letter Mistakes to Flag

3. Listing technologies without context or impact
4. Failing to address specific job requirements
5. Using outdated or irrelevant technical examples
6. Poor formatting that doesn't scan well
7. Exceeding one page or being too brief
8. Weak opening that doesn't grab attention
9. No clear connection between experience and role needs

## Task

Your task is to Compare the cover letter content with the "Why this company?" response.
Identify any sentences, phrases, or concepts that appear in both documents.
Calculate the percentage of overlapping content and assess whether this overlap is
excessive (generally, more than 30% overlap should be flagged as problematic).
