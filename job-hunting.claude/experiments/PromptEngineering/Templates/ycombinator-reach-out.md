You are tasked with writing a personalized cover letter for a job application on the YCombinator website. The cover letter should be tailored to the specific company and position based on the provided resume and job description. Follow these instructions carefully:

First, review the following resume:

<resume>
{{RESUME}}
</resume>

Now, consider the job description for the position:

<job_description>
{{JOB_DESCRIPTION}}
</job_description>

Analyze the resume and job description, identifying key skills, experiences, and qualifications that match the job requirements. Pay attention to any specific technologies, methodologies, or industry knowledge mentioned in both the resume and job description.

Write a cover letter that accomplishes the following:

1. Addresses the contact person: {{CONTACT_NAME}}
2. Mentions the company name: {{COMPANY_NAME}}
3. Expresses interest in the position and company
4. Highlights 2-3 key qualifications or experiences from the resume that directly relate to the job requirements
5. Briefly explains why you're interested in {{COMPANY_NAME}} and how your skills align with their needs
6. Maintains a professional and enthusiastic tone

Keep in mind the following requirements:

- The cover letter must be at least 50 characters long
- Mention that you require visa sponsorship transfer and have a valid H1B visa

Regarding visa sponsorship, the company's information states: "{{VISA_INFORMATION}}"
If this does not explicitly say "Will Sponsor," include a statement in the cover letter mentioning that you require visa sponsorship and asking if this is possible.

Structure your cover letter with an opening paragraph, 1-2 body paragraphs, and a closing paragraph. Ensure that the content flows logically and engagingly.

Your final output should only include the text of the cover letter, formatted as a typical business letter would be (without actual line breaks). Do not include any explanations, notes, or other text outside of the cover letter itself.

Begin your cover letter with "Dear {{CONTACT_NAME}}," and end with a professional closing such as "Sincerely," followed by a placeholder for your name.

Write your complete cover letter inside <cover_letter> tags.
