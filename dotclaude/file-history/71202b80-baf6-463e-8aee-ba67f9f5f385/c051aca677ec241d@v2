# Windows Administration Scripts - Implementation Tasks

**Repository**: https://github.com/jaodsilv/windows-admin-scripts (to be created)
**Status**: Repository needs to be created and initialized
**Visibility**: PUBLIC

## Overview

This repository will contain production-ready Windows system administration scripts for profile repair, permission management, backup operations, and system diagnostics.

## Source Location

**Primary Source**: `D:/src/scripts/`

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Repository Creation on GitHub

```bash
"C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" repo create jaodsilv/windows-admin-scripts --public --description "Windows system administration scripts for profile repair, permission management, backup, and diagnostics"
```

### 2. Repository Initialization

Initialize the local repository structure:

```bash
cd D:/src
mkdir -p windows-admin-scripts
cd windows-admin-scripts
git init
git branch -M main
```

### 3. Pre-Transfer Security Review

**CRITICAL**: Before transferring content, review for sensitive data:

```bash
cd D:/src/scripts

# Check for hardcoded passwords or credentials
grep -r "password" . --include="*.bat" --include="*.ps1"
grep -r "credential" . --include="*.bat" --include="*.ps1"
grep -r "secret" . --include="*.bat" --include="*.ps1"

# Check for hardcoded paths that might reveal username
grep -r "C:\\Users\\" . --include="*.bat" --include="*.ps1"

# Review registry backup files (should NOT be committed)
ls -la *.reg
```

**Action Items**:
1. Replace any hardcoded usernames with variables or placeholders
2. Remove any passwords or credentials
3. Template any machine-specific paths
4. Mark registry backup files for exclusion

### 4. Content Transfer

Transfer content from scripts/ directory:

```bash
cd D:/src/windows-admin-scripts

# Transfer all content
cp -r ../scripts/* ./

# Verify transfer
ls -R
```

### 5. Organize Repository Structure

Create logical directory organization:

```bash
# Create organized directories
mkdir -p "Profile Repair"
mkdir -p "Permissions"
mkdir -p "Backup"
mkdir -p "Migration"
mkdir -p "Diagnostics"
mkdir -p "Documentation"
mkdir -p "Templates"

# Move files to appropriate directories
# (This should be done based on actual file inventory)
# Example moves:
mv emergency_repair_all_profiles.bat "Profile Repair/"
mv fix_single_profile.bat "Profile Repair/"
mv grant_full_permissions.bat "Permissions/"
mv backup_user_profiles.bat "Backup/"
mv migrate_to_local_account.bat "Migration/"
mv system_health_check.bat "Diagnostics/"
mv current_scripts_inventory.md "Documentation/"
mv README.md "Documentation/" 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 6. Create .gitignore

Create `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive and machine-specific files:

```gitignore
# Registry backups with machine-specific data
*.reg
registry_backup_*.reg
profile_list_backup.reg

# Logs with potential sensitive data
*.log
logs/

# Test outputs
test-output/
temp/

# Machine-specific configs
config/machine-specific/
local-config/

# Backup files (in case scripts create backups)
*.bak
backup_*.zip

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Editor files
*.swp
*.swo
*~
.vscode/
.idea/

# PowerShell module cache
PSModuleCache/

# Windows shortcuts
*.lnk
```

### 7. Template Machine-Specific Content

Create template versions of any machine-specific scripts:

**Example Template**: `Templates/fix_single_profile.template.bat`
```batch
@echo off
REM Template: Replace <USERNAME> with actual username

set TARGET_USER=<USERNAME>
set PROFILE_PATH=C:\Users\%TARGET_USER%

REM Script continues...
```

### 8. Create Comprehensive README.md

Document the script collection:

```markdown

4. **Check prerequisites** listed in script comments

### During Execution

1. **Monitor output** for errors or warnings
2. **Capture logs** for troubleshooting
3. **Verify results** after completion
4. **Keep original files** until verified

### After Execution

2. **Validate changes** worked as expected
3. **Test system functionality** affected by changes
4. **Document any issues** encountered

## Script Categories

### 1. Profile Repair
- Emergency repair for corrupted profiles
- Single profile repair and validation
- Junction point safety checks
- Comprehensive profile diagnostics

### 2. Permission Management
- Grant full control permissions
- Reset to default Windows permissions
- Verify permission inheritance
- Fix broken permission chains

### 3. Backup and Recovery
- Automated profile backups
- Backup validation and integrity checks
- Profile restoration from backups
- Incremental backup support

### 4. Account Migration
- Local to domain account migration
- Profile data transfer
- Permission preservation
- Post-migration validation

### 5. System Diagnostics
- System health checks
- Profile integrity validation
- Disk space analysis
- Service status verification

## Customization

### Using Templates

1. Copy template from `Templates/` directory
2. Replace placeholder values (e.g., `<USERNAME>`, `<PATH>`)
3. Customize logic as needed
4. Test in safe environment
5. Document customizations

### Creating New Scripts

Follow these guidelines when creating new administration scripts:

1. **Error Handling**:
   \```batch
   if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
       echo Error occurred: %ERRORLEVEL%
       goto :ERROR
   )
   \```

2. **Logging**:
   \```batch
   set LOG_FILE=%~dp0logs\%~n0_%date:~-4,4%%date:~-10,2%%date:~-7,2%.log
   echo [%date% %time%] Starting script >> %LOG_FILE%
   \```

3. **Backup Before Modify**:
   \```batch
   REM Always backup before modifications
   xcopy "%TARGET%" "%BACKUP_DIR%" /E /I /Y
   \```

4. **Progress Indicators**:
   \```batch
   echo [1/5] Checking prerequisites...
   echo [2/5] Creating backup...
   \```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Create test environment (VM or isolated system)
2. Run script with test data
3. Verify expected results
4. Check logs for errors
5. Validate rollback capabilities

### Automated Testing (Future)

- Unit tests for PowerShell functions
- Integration tests for workflows
- Validation scripts for outputs

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Permission Denied**:
   - Run as Administrator
   - Check UAC settings
   - Verify file/folder permissions

2. **Script Not Found**:
   - Check working directory
   - Use absolute paths
   - Verify file was not blocked (right-click → Properties → Unblock)

3. **Access Denied to Profile**:
   - Profile may be in use (log off user)
   - Check profile folder permissions
   - Verify junction points are valid

See [Documentation/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](Documentation/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed troubleshooting guide.
